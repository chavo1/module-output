# Module1

Quick start

Please note that this example will deploy real resources into your AWS account. We have made every effort to ensure all the resources qualify for the AWS Free Tier, but we are not responsible for any charges you may incur.

Prerequisites:

An AWS user account with awscli access privileges is needed You can get one here https://aws.amazon.com
Export your AWS user credentials into the env before building the web server infrastructure using:
 
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)
```

This will deploy a web server with public accessible web page on port 80 (HTTP).
